# Sheepwall

This is a http traffic parser intended to record unprotected account, password and cookies running on **router devices**.

Features:
- High performance
	- It is designed to be run on **routers** so it is written in C/C++
- It has been tested to be worked on [rt1900ac](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/RT1900ac) and [rt2600ac](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/RT2600ac)
- ASUS routers (ex: RT-AC68U which I have tested) with [DD-WRT](https://www.dd-wrt.com/) also work well!
	- Most original Asus router firmwares are shipped with Linux kernel 2.6.36.4 which is too old and I don't want to support it. If you are interested, you can use ASUS's [toolchain](https://github.com/kvic-z/brcm-arm-toolchains) to build this project (modifications are needed cause g++ 4.5.3 does not support C++14).

## Demo

Just run the sheepwall and wait for the sheep to come in :).

## Usage

Quick installation

```
# Download sheepwall binary and put it into you router
SynologyRouter> curl -L https://github.com/chiehmin/sheepwall/releases/download/v0.1.1/sheepwall_arm > sheepwall
```

```
$ sheepwall -i <interface> [-w <log file>] [-D]
options:
  -h [ --help ]          Print help messages
  -i [ --interface ] arg Interface sniffered by sheepwall
  -w [ --write_to ] arg  Log file
  -D [ --daemon ]        Daemonizing... run in the background
```

## Building

This project uses `libpcap`, `boost` and `googletest`. After installing all above libraries, just simply execute `make` to build this project.

### Build for ARM-based devices

### Cross-compile `libpcap`

We need the arm version of `libpcap` to build our sheepwall. Here I used the `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc` from Ubuntu's `g++-arm-linux-gnueabi` package.

Download it!

```
$ mkdir ~/arm-libpcap
# download the libpcap source code
$ curl -L https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/archive/libpcap-1.8.1.tar.gz > libpcap.tar.gz
# extract it
$ tar -hxf libpcap.tar.gz
```

compile it!!

```
$ mkdir ~/arm-libpcap
$ CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc \
./configure --host=arm-linux --prefix=/home/fatminmin/arm-libpcap --with-pcap=linux
$ make -j4
$ make install
```

Finally, the compiled `libpcap` will be put under `/home/fatminmin/arm-libpcap`

### Cross-compile boost

```
$ curl -L https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.66.0/source/boost_1_66_0.tar.gz > boost.tar.gz
$ tar -hxf boost.tar.gz && cd boost_1_66_0
# we only use program_options library here
$ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=program_options
```

Modify `using gcc ;` to  `using gcc : arm : arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ ;` in `project-config.jam`

```
# compile it
$ mkdir ~/arm-boost
$ ./bjam install toolset=gcc-arm runtime-link=static --prefix=/home/fatminmin/arm-boost
```

### Compile sheepwall

In the `Makefile`, I re-defined the [Target-specific Variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Target_002dspecific.html) to compile sheepwall for ARM deviced.

```makefile
arm: CXX := arm-linux-gnueabi-g++
arm: CXXFLAGS += -I/home/fatminmin/arm-boost/include -I/home/fatminmin/arm-libpcap/include
arm: LDFLAGS += -L/home/fatminmin/arm-boost/lib -L/home/fatminmin/arm-libpcap/lib -static
arm: build/sheepwall
```

### Run it

Send it to your arm devices(Synology rt1900ac for example) and run it.

```
$ scp build/sheepwall root@router.synology.com:/root
# in the router console
SynologyRouter> ./sheepwall -i eth0 -w cred.log -D
```
